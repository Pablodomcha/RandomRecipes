Tutorial costs are free (the mod assumes you use "Onboarding")

-Categories:
    1. Materials* (equipment things are materials)
    2. Structures
    2.1. Progressive Structures (ie: Belts, Crafters)
    3. MAM Research
    3.1. Progressive MAM (ie: Depot Upgrades) positions are not randomized, but their costs are.**
    
*A minable resource is only considered unlocked when scannable.
*Hazmat, Iodine filter and Uranium Scan need an external check to enable uranium.
**Hard to ensure they are in order.


-Treatment:
    1. Materials
        Moved from unavailable to available when added to a tier.
    2. Structures
        If Crafting, increases 
    3. MAM Research

-Costs:
    1. Milestones:
        1-16 resources.*
    2. Elevtor Parts:
        1-4 resources.*
    3. Items:
        1-X where X is the max number of slots for the selected production structure
        First Randomize production structure, then randomize materials.

*More may work, but testing it is not worth it.

Info:
    1. Handcrafts: For simplicity, everything craftable in Constructors/Smelters can be made by hand and anything else won't.
    2. Craft unlocked != Craft Possible.
    3. Anything not strictly necessary is randomized at the end and therefore can use all materials (for example blueprint maker, belts, vehicles, alternate recipes).
    4. Production buildings may not be able to reach 100% efficiency on certain recipes.
    5. Packaging/unpackaging recipes unaffected (the container recipes are though).
    6. Excited Photonic Matter is not free. Blame Ficsit.
    7. Recipes obtained from tier 0 are craftable using only each other.
    8. MAM researches are all considered non-essential, the ones that are will be moved to milestones. Non-essential things will be moved from milestones to MAM in exchange.
    9. All materials are treated the same, so you could end up with the screw being as expensive as a vanilla uranium fuel rod and vice versa.
    10. If for whatever reason introducing the same seed creates different paths for different players, you can work arround it by having one player create the files and send them to the others. This should be reported as a bug regardless.

-Options (Toggle):
    1. Ore location:
        Easy: You don't need ores you can't scan to unlock the ability to scan them. Uranium will only be needed if you can have radiation protection.
        Medium: Any ore can be part of any recipe. Uranium will only be needed if you can have radiation protection.
        Radiation Party: Uranium could be needed for recipes unlocked before you can have radiation protection.
    2. Belts:
        Easy: Only use raw ore, ensuring they can always be made (though you may need to search for the ore without scan).
        Medium: Tier 1 belt and pole only uses raw ore. Other belts can use anything (guarantees at least access to basic belts).
        Hard: Uses anything, you could end up with no access to belts for part/most of your playthrough.
    3. Electricity:
        Easy: Basic electric poles and biomass burners use only raw ore and are cheap.
        Medium: Basic electric poles use only raw ore and are cheap.
        Hard: Have fun with your handcrafting (poles and biomass burners will still be buildable from the start, but they might be really expensive).
    4. Waste (the "desired" output is the one for which the recipe is generated, even if you like more the other output):
        Easy: Recipes only have 1 output, so you don't need to handle a second resource you may not need.
        Medium: Recipes can have solid outputs other than the desired, but the Awesome sink recipe will be available from the start and only use raw ore.
        Hard: Recipes can have solid outputs other than the desired and the Awesome sink may not be available or have really hard crafting recipe.
        No U: Recipes can have solid/liquid outputs other than the desired and the sink may not be available or have really hard crafting recipe. Packaging to get rid of liquids may or may not be easy, you may need tons deposits and manual flushing.
    5. Liquids:
        Only liquid: Liquids can only be used in their liquid form for recipes (this is the case for the base game).
        Packaged and Liquid: Packaged liquids can be part of recipes. Packaging could be really expensive (or not).
    6. Power:
        Vanilla: Structures use vanilla power. It's fun until you have to run Particle Accelerators on Biomass Burners.
        Balanced: Structures obtained earlier consume less energy. If your Particle Accelerator is Tier 2, it will consume on average what a foundry does.
        Random: I felt like adding this. The idea is really funny, the gameplay isn't (the min value is 10MW and the max is 2GW)
    7. Inventory slots: (The number of upgrades that give slots is not randomized, only the amount of slots they give and the milestones/MAM research they appear in).
        Fixed: The amount of slots is fixed, uses Max value (with this option Min values is ignored). MAM researches that give these give double.
        Random: The amount of slots is random between the values provided. MAM researches double the randomized value (yes, this means MAM always gives an even number of slots).
        Max: Number (min 1).
        Min: Number (min 1).

    1. Materials inicialization, add other ores as available or not.
    2. Structure randomization, use or not generic logic for belts.
    3. Structure randomization, use or not generic logic for Poles/cables.
    4. Sequence Generation in products and Structure randomization.
    5. Add packaged liquid materials to Materials initialization. Extra check for Packager and the liquid.
    6. Change craft station energy use in their sequencer.
    7. Edit the value for inventory slot rewards in milestone inicialization.

-Options (Insert Value): Don't put the Max Stack or Max items to 0, for free recipes use the specific option.
    0. Seed.
    1. Max stack per component: Maximum number of each component needed for a craft.
    2. Max component per craft: Maximum number of each component produced by a craft. 
    3. Max stack per structure: Maximum number of each component needed to build with the builder tool.
    4. Max items per structure: Maximum number of different items to build with the builder tool.
    5. Max stack per milestone: Maximum number of each component needed to complete a milestone.
    6. Max items per milestone: Maximum number of different items to complete a milestone.
    7. Max time per milestone: Maximum time to research a new milestone after completing one or time to complete a MAM research.
    8. Max stack per elevator part: Maximum number of each component needed to complete a Project Assembly stage.
    9. Max items per elevator part: Maximum number of different items to complete a Project Assembly stage.
    10. Max time to craft: Maximum time needed for a craft.
    11. Handcrafting speed min,max: Multiplier for handcrafting speed. Lower is faster (the base game value is usually between 0.5 and 1 depending on recipe).
    12. Slot bias: Higher numbers mean that the randomizer will try to use more of the slots available in the production station. 100 means always will use all slots, 0 means all recipes use 1 input/output slot, 50 means there's no bias. If waste is in easy, this only affects input. This also affects the amount of resources used for structures.
    13. Max recipes used: Maximum number of recipes that can use a materials. The randomizer will increase this value if it can't complete a randomization.
